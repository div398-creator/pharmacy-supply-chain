# Pharma Supply Chain System using Smart Contracts

## Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges related to the security and integrity of the supply chain, including issues such as counterfeiting, diversion, and theft. These challenges can compromise patient safety, reduce the effectiveness of drugs, and cause financial losses for companies. Traditional paper-based supply chain management systems are outdated and inefficient, increasing the likelihood of errors and delays.

This project provides a console-based simulation of a Pharma Supply Chain System using the concept of smart contracts. The system is designed to create a transparent and immutable record of every transaction in the supply chain, preventing fraud, counterfeiting, and other illegal activities.

## Features
- **Immutable Transactions:** Every transaction in the supply chain is recorded and cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of the data.
- **Drug Verification:** Allows verification of the authenticity of drugs based on their unique ID.
- **Drug Tracing:** Tracks the status of a drug from manufacture to consumption.
- **Console-Based Application:** No need for a frontend or database storage; all interactions are through the console.

## Goals
- **Transparency & Security:** Ensure a secure and transparent supply chain system to prevent fraud and counterfeiting.
- **Efficiency:** Reduce time and resources required to manage the supply chain.
- **Cost Reduction:** Improve overall efficiency and reduce costs associated with managing the supply chain.
- **Protection Against Threats:** Prevent hacking, data breaches, and other security threats.
